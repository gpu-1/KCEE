# Implementation log

## 2026-10-13 — Run registry milestone
- Bracket API persists verified run manifests in PostgreSQL before returning success.
- Added paginated history, record retrieval, integrity verification and readiness endpoints.
- Added restricted application role and append-only mutation triggers.
- Added explicit import/recovery for existing and interrupted runs.
- Fixed bracket pipeline when Git is absent in container.
- Locked Python transitive dependencies and API/database base image digests.
- Verified ARM64 API/database build; eight unit tests and four PostgreSQL/API integration tests pass.
- Native AI/PicoGK/voice and numerical solver adapters remain pending; all bracket results remain unvalidated analytical screening.
